Plug in the RP2040 feather to your computer. Next, hold down 'boot sel'
button and press the 'reset' button (while holding 'boot sel'). Release
'boot sel' and the RP2040 feather should appear as a USB flash/thumb
drive. Copy the .uf2 file in this directory to the drive. The RP2040
feather should reset and reappear as a drive with a 'code.py' file and
a 'libs' directory. Copy the files in the 'libs' directory in this
directory (the 'neopixel.mpy' and 'adafruit_pixelbuf.mpy' files)
to the 'libs' directory on the RP2040 feather.

You should now be ready to load any of the examples for this workshop
onto the RP2040 feather!
