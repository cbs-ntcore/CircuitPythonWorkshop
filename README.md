Welcome!

This 2 hour workshop will introduce you to using CircuitPython to bridge the
digital and physical worlds. You'll learn how to program a small, specialized
computer (a microcontroller) to control devices in the physical world. This
workshop is hands on and you will:
- wire up a circuit
- program a microcontroller
- build an electronic instrument to measure reaction time
- use the instrument to generate data on your reaction time

The course material is divided into:
- a list of parts to order for each participant
- a project template (used for all examples)
- lecture slides
- example code

To aid initial learning the microcontrollers are preloaded with CircuitPython
(and a few libraries). For instructors (or those following independent study,
see 'template' for setup instructions).
